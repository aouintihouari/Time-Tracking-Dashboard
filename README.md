# Time-Tracking-Dashboard
A responsive dashboard built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to track time spent on activities. Utilizes Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout, with media queries and responsive units for adaptability. JavaScript adds interactivity by dynamically updating content based on user selection, fetching data from a JSON file. An exercise from Frontend Mentor.
